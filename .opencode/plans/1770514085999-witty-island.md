## Objective
Perform a code review for the current workspace state (default mode: all uncommitted changes), focusing on real bugs and actionable risks only.

## Findings From Initial Exploration
- `git diff` and `git diff --cached` are empty (no tracked file edits).
- `git status --short` shows only untracked directories: `.claude/` and `.opencode/`.
- Untracked content appears to be local tooling/config artifacts (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `.opencode/package.json`, `.opencode/bun.lock`, `.opencode/node_modules/**`, prior plan files).
- Root `.gitignore` currently does not ignore `.claude/` or `.opencode/`.

## Recommended Review Output
1. State clearly that there are no modified/staged tracked code changes to review.
2. Report one actionable risk:
   - Local machine/tooling artifacts are untracked and could be accidentally committed, creating repository noise and potential leakage of local command permission config.
3. Assign severity as low-to-medium (repository hygiene / accidental exposure risk, not runtime bug).
4. Provide concrete remediation:
   - Add `.claude/` and `.opencode/` to root `.gitignore` (or at minimum `.opencode/node_modules/`, `.opencode/bun.lock`, and local settings files).

## Verification
- Re-run:
  - `git diff`
  - `git diff --cached`
  - `git status --short`
- Confirm review statements match actual workspace state.
