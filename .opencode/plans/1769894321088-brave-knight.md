# Dead Code Cleanup Plan (Full Repo Sweep)

## Goal
Remove PMD dead-code violations (unused private fields/methods, unused locals, unused parameters) across the entire repo while preserving required reflective/MethodHandle usage and generated/runtime wiring.

## Plan
1) Generate a scoped dead-code report
   - Run PMD dead-code ruleset on the full repo and collect the report path(s).
   - Split violations by area: `memris-core/src/main/java`, `memris-core/src/test/java`, docs/examples, misc artifacts.

2) Triage and categorize violations
   - Classify each violation as: safe delete, used via reflection/ByteBuddy/MethodHandles, test fixture, or intentional API shape.
   - For reflective usage, add minimal documentation or suppressions only when unavoidable (prefer keeping code if actively used by generated classes).

3) Remove unused locals/params first
   - Fix trivial unused locals and unused parameters (delete or refactor).
   - Prefer minimal refactors: inline, delete dead branches, or simplify logic.

4) Remove unused private fields/methods
   - Delete genuinely unused members in production code.
   - For members used by reflection/ByteBuddy, add a narrow suppression with a short comment explaining the reflective access point.

5) Sweep tests/examples/docs
   - Remove unused code in tests and examples where safe (unused fixtures, helpers, or dead tests).
   - Keep documentation examples intact unless PMD scans them; prefer excluding docs from PMD if needed.

6) Re-run PMD dead-code checks and full verify
   - Confirm dead-code violations are at zero (or only documented suppressions remain).
   - Run `mvn.cmd -q -e verify` to ensure the build is green.

## Critical Files (expected to change)
- `pmd-deadcode.xml`
- `pom.xml`
- `memris-core/src/main/java/**`

## Verification
- `mvn.cmd -q -e verify`
