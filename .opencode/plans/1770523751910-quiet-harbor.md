## Objective
Review all uncommitted changes and provide actionable bug-focused feedback with severity and concrete failure scenarios.

## Scope Confirmed
- Review mode: default (no commit/branch/PR argument) -> inspect unstaged + staged + untracked.
- Changed files identified:
  - `memris-core/.classpath`
  - `memris-core/src/main/java/io/memris/storage/heap/AbstractTable.java`
  - `memris-core/src/main/java/io/memris/storage/heap/BytecodeTableGenerator.java`
  - `memris-core/src/test/java/io/memris/storage/heap/BytecodeTableGeneratorTest.java`

## Recommended Approach
1. Use `git diff`, `git diff --cached`, and `git status --short` to enumerate exact review target.
2. Read full modified source files (not only hunks) to validate intent against surrounding logic, especially runtime/bytecode code paths.
3. Focus findings on new/modified code only, prioritizing correctness and runtime safety over style.
4. Validate each suspected issue against existing architecture assumptions in the same module before flagging.
5. Produce review output with:
   - severity level,
   - exact file/line references,
   - concrete trigger conditions,
   - direct explanation of impact.

## Critical Files To Inspect During Review
- `memris-core/src/main/java/io/memris/storage/heap/BytecodeTableGenerator.java`
- `memris-core/src/main/java/io/memris/storage/heap/AbstractTable.java`
- `memris-core/src/test/java/io/memris/storage/heap/BytecodeTableGeneratorTest.java`

## Verification
- Static verification: ensure generated bytecode invokes only accessible methods with correct opcodes/signatures.
- Behavioral verification: confirm scan/read/tombstone flows preserve previous semantics and do not introduce runtime linkage errors.
- Optional local confirmation command (if execution phase is approved):
  - `mvn.cmd -q -e -pl memris-core test -Dtest=BytecodeTableGeneratorTest`
